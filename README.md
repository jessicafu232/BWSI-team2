# **Configuration Files**
## Configuration Files - Emulator Type
**Configuration Files contain crucial information to both Receive and Analyze Data. Make sure that both emulator.py and analyzer.py refer to the same file. Contrary to the Analyzer Type, Emulator Type Config Files are used when running the emulator to receive data, and thus contain more information on the emulator configuration**
